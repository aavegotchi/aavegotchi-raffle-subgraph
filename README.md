If you miss something or found a bug please feel free to create an issue.

## Development

If you never worked with the graph before. We recommend to take some time to understand the core concepts of the graph. A good entry is their [TheGraph Docs](https://thegraph.com/docs/developer/quick-start).

1. Start a graph node, connected to an Polygon Archive Node. 
2. In order to install all lib please run ```yarn```
3. If the graph node runs locally you can simply run ```yarn create-local``` which creates the subgraph on the graph node. 
4. Afterwards you run ```yarn deploy-local``` which deploys the subgraph to the graph nodes and the indexing process starts. This can take up to 24 hours.
